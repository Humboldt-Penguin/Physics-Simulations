[VPython](https://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/index.html) is a library that uses a 3D graphics module called Visual to display 3D objects. GlowScript is a browser python IDE that comes with VPython and Matplotlib.

## 3. Electricity and Magnetism

### 3.1. Rutherford Scattering

[Link to run](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/ZainKamal/folder/MyPrograms/program/3.1.Rutherford-Scattering)

> The Geiger–Marsden experiments (also called the Rutherford gold foil experiment) were a landmark series of experiments by which scientists learned that every atom has a nucleus where all of its positive charge and most of its mass is concentrated. They deduced this after measuring how an alpha particle beam is scattered when it strikes a thin metal foil. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger-Marsden_experiments))

A fun little quote from Rutherford himself:
> It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.

## Future Project Ideas

- [ ] Augment Project 2.1. (Basic Solar System) with a randomized asteroid belt
- [ ] Model spaghettification phenomena with my [gravity function](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/ZainKamal/folder/Reference/program/GravityFunction/edit) and vpython springs
- [ ] Account for collisions in Project 2.2. (N-Body Simulations) to prevent infinite gravitational force when bodies are extremely close
- [ ] 3D game of life inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQJ5aEsP6Fs)
- [ ] Model a piece of rope with vpython springs
