## 0. Bounce

[Link to run](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/ZainKamal/folder/MyPrograms/program/0.Bounce)

## 1. Basic Solar System

[Link to run](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/ZainKamal/folder/MyPrograms/program/1.Solar-System(Basic))

## 2. Three Body Problem

[Link to run](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/ZainKamal/folder/MyPrograms/program/2.Three-Body-Sim)

This is separate from project 3 because I particularly liked these initial conditions.

## 3. Randomized N-Body Simulation

[Link to run](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/ZainKamal/folder/MyPrograms/program/3.Randomized-n-Body-Sim)

TODO:
* Account for collisions to prevent "explosion to infinity"

## 4. Rutherford Scattering

[Link to run](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/ZainKamal/folder/MyPrograms/program/4.Rutherford-Scattering)

> The Geiger–Marsden experiments (also called the Rutherford gold foil experiment) were a landmark series of experiments by which scientists learned that every atom has a nucleus where all of its positive charge and most of its mass is concentrated. They deduced this after measuring how an alpha particle beam is scattered when it strikes a thin metal foil. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger-Marsden_experiments))

A fun little quote from Rutherford himself:
> It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.

## Future Project Ideas

* Augment Project 1 with a randomized asteroid belt (1.1)
* Model spaghettification phenomena with my [gravity function](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/ZainKamal/folder/Reference/program/GravityFunction/edit) and vpython springs
* Account for collisions in Project 3
* 3D game of life inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQJ5aEsP6Fs)
* Model a string with vpython springs
